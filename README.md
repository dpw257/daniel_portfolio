* Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $11k) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
* Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from Glassdoor using Python and Selenium.
* Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on Python, Excel, AWS, and Spark.
* Optimized linear, lasso, and random forest regressors using GridsearchCV to achieve best model.
* Built a client-facing API using FLASK
